# ✅ Verify @litetable Organization

After creating the organization, verify it's ready:

## Check in Browser

Go to: https://www.npmjs.com/org/litetable

Should show:
```
@litetable
Members: 1 (you)
Packages: 0
```

## Check via Command Line

```bash
# This should work now (after org created)
npm access ls-packages litetable

# If not ready yet, wait 1-2 minutes
```

## Ready to Publish?

Once you see the org page, tell me **"org ready"** and I'll start publishing!

---

**Troubleshooting:**

If org creation fails:
- Check if "litetable" name is taken
- Try: "litetables" or "lite-table" instead
- Or we can use Option 2 (no org needed)
